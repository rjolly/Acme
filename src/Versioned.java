/// Interface for versioned objects.
// <P>
// This interface should be used by classes that need to differentiate
// versions of themselves.  For instance, a class that is able to
// serialize itself and write a representation to a disk file needs
// to keep track of versions, so that it doesn't try to deserialize
// an old version.  For this reason, the Serializable interface inherits
// from this one.
